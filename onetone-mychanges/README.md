This is a project created for client Sarah Chaminade ('Chef Chaminade') that is deployed with Wordpress, and uses the free theme 'Onetone' designed by 'MageeWP Themes'

I have gone into the editor and customized some of the css files to make updates based on the clients specifications.

I have also incorporated Vanilla WordPress pages into the site by adding a link (found in the header) that leads to a blogs post section per the clients request to be able to add blog content to the site.
